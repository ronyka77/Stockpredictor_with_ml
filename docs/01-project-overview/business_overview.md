# Stock Prediction System - Business Overview

## Project Purpose and Value Proposition

This stock prediction system represents a sophisticated approach to forecasting price movements for a carefully selected portfolio of 50-100 US stocks across multiple time horizons. The system targets prediction accuracy of 60% using a custom metric that considers both directional accuracy and magnitude precision, specifically measuring success when predicted prices fall within 10% of actual prices or when the system correctly predicts upward movement regardless of exact magnitude.

The core value proposition centers on maximizing predictive performance through comprehensive data integration and advanced modeling techniques. By combining historical price patterns, technical indicators, fundamental company metrics, and real-time news sentiment analysis, the system creates a multi-dimensional view of market dynamics that individual data sources cannot provide alone.

## Strategic Approach and Methodology

The system employs a three-tier prediction framework targeting 10-day, 30-day, and 90-day forecasting horizons. This multi-horizon approach recognizes that different market forces operate across varying timeframes, from short-term technical momentum to longer-term fundamental value realization. The system adapts its modeling approach based on these temporal characteristics, potentially using different feature sets and model architectures for each prediction window.

Data integration forms the foundation of the system's competitive advantage. Raw market data, including historical prices and trading volumes, provides the quantitative backbone. Technical indicators derived from price movements capture momentum, volatility, and trend characteristics that professional traders rely upon. Fundamental metrics such as earnings ratios, debt levels, and growth rates anchor predictions in underlying business performance. News sentiment analysis transforms qualitative market information into quantitative signals, capturing market psychology and event-driven price movements that purely numerical approaches might miss.

The modeling strategy emphasizes ensemble techniques that combine multiple algorithmic approaches rather than relying on any single method. This diversification reduces model risk while capturing different aspects of market behavior. Time series models excel at identifying temporal patterns and seasonality effects. Gradient boosting algorithms effectively handle complex feature interactions and non-linear relationships. Deep learning approaches can discover subtle patterns in high-dimensional data that traditional methods might overlook.

## Implementation Architecture and Scalability

The system architecture separates raw data storage from engineered features to optimize both data integrity and computational performance. PostgreSQL serves as the authoritative source for all raw data, providing ACID compliance, efficient querying capabilities, and robust data validation. This structured approach ensures data quality and enables complex cross-dataset analysis, such as correlating news events with price movements or fundamental changes.

Engineered features are stored in Parquet format, leveraging columnar storage for rapid model training and inference. This separation allows the system to regenerate features efficiently when new raw data arrives or when feature engineering approaches evolve. The architecture supports both batch processing for historical analysis and incremental updates for real-time prediction capabilities.

Model specialization represents a key strategic decision where different stocks or stock groups may benefit from tailored modeling approaches. Technology stocks might respond differently to news sentiment compared to utility stocks, and the system can adapt its feature weighting and model selection accordingly. This specialization approach recognizes that market sectors exhibit distinct behavioral patterns that generic models might not capture effectively.

## Risk Management and Performance Optimization

The system incorporates multiple layers of validation and backtesting to ensure robust performance across different market conditions. Walk-forward validation simulates real-world trading scenarios where models are trained on historical data and tested on subsequent periods. This approach reveals how models perform during market volatility, sector rotations, and economic cycles.

Experiment tracking through MLflow provides systematic documentation of model iterations, hyperparameter configurations, and performance metrics. This scientific approach enables rapid identification of promising modeling directions while avoiding repeated exploration of unsuccessful approaches. The tracking system also supports model versioning and rollback capabilities essential for production deployment.

The custom accuracy metric balances precision requirements with practical trading considerations. By accepting predictions that correctly identify upward movement regardless of exact magnitude, the system acknowledges that profitable trading often depends more on directional accuracy than precise price targeting. This metric design aligns model optimization with real-world investment objectives.

## Expected Outcomes and Success Metrics

Success will be measured primarily through the custom 60% accuracy target, but the system also tracks traditional metrics including precision, recall, and mean absolute percentage error across different time horizons. Performance analysis will segment results by stock characteristics, market conditions, and prediction timeframes to identify the system's strengths and limitations.

The modular architecture enables continuous improvement through iterative development cycles. New data sources can be integrated without disrupting existing functionality. Feature engineering approaches can be refined based on performance analysis. Model architectures can evolve as new techniques become available or as market dynamics shift.

This comprehensive approach to stock prediction combines rigorous data science methodology with practical trading considerations, creating a system designed for sustained predictive performance across varying market conditions while maintaining the flexibility to adapt and improve over time.

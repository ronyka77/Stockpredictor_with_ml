"""
Data Utils Package

This package provides comprehensive data loading, transformation, and preparation
utilities for ML models, organized into focused modules:

- target_engineering: Target transformation functions (absolute to percentage returns)
- feature_engineering: Feature transformation and cleaning functions
- ml_data_pipeline: Main pipeline functions for ML data preparation

Key improvements implemented:
- Phase 1: Target engineering (absolute prices â†’ percentage returns)
- Phase 2: Price-normalized features and prediction bounds
- Comprehensive data cleaning and caching system
